"OVERVIEW OF PROJECT"

PROJECT : DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG

OBJECTIVE
 Design basic digital logic circuits like logic gates, adders, and multiplexers using
 Verilog within the VLSI software. Simulate the Verilog designs to ensure correct
 functionality. Use the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze the
 simulation results.

 KEY ACTIVITIES
 1- BY USING GATE LAVEL AND DATA FLOW LEVEL I DESGINE DIGITAL CIRCUIT
 2- USE THE METHOD OF INSTANTIATION TO DESGIN THE CIRCUIT

 TECHNOLOGY USED
 VERILOG : PROGRAMING LANGUAGE TO DESGIN THE CIRCUIT
 WAVEFORM : USE WAVEFORM VIWER TO ANALYS THE CORRECTNESS OF CODE
